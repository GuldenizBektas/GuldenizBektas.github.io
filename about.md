<p>Hi there 👋🏼
It's Güldeniz but you can call me Deniz. I recently graduated from İstanbul University's Astronomy and Space Sciences department. I started at Denebunu as a Jr Data Scientist, one and only precious, one person data team. It's been a great experience so far. Also, I'm a Women Techmaker Ambassador and #IamRemarkable Facilitator.
</p>

<p>
Beside these stuff I have a lot in my plate, by which I mean I'm trying to do a lot of community works and self improvement studies. For example I'm an organization team member at Devnot, ex-fellow of Akbank Fellowship Program and guide of Deep Learning Study Group at inzva. I'll be a part of ML Bootcamp that organizes by GDG İstanbul and inzva partnership. I'll be the guide of DL Specialization course's one week and facilitator of the program throughout the bootcamp.
</p>

<p>
I'm interested in GAN's, computer vision generally. Working on those topics in my free time. And I have a podcast named "Yapay mı Bu Zeka?" (Is this intelligence artificial?). This podcast is held in Turkish only, unfortunaly 😥 But have some plans for English for the future. Give this podcast some love and I'm on it faster. I write on Medium too. My articles are publishing through Analytics Vidhya, The Start Up (Start It Up) and Geek Culture publications.
